# Learning Python Twisted

Currently working through the book [Twisted Network Programming Essentials] (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Twisted-Network-Programming-Essentials-McKellar/dp/1449326110/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1499008764&sr=8-1&keywords=twisted+python) to try and get up to speed with event-driven networking.

So far there's been a number of errata in the book (I'm using the latest (as of July 2017) Kindle version) so the code in the repository has been fixed where I've been able to.  Hopefully it will help somebody if they come unstuck.
